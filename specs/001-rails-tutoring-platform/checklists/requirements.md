## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. **Password Reset (FR-011)**: Administrator-only resets initially, with email-based self-service planned for future
2. **User Deactivation (FR-016)**: Soft-delete with configurable retention period
3. **File Uploads (FR-035)**: Common document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG) with configurable limits (default 10MB)

**Next Steps**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation planning artifacts.
